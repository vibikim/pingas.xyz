# The files for an amazing website called **www.pingas.xyz**

One reason you may want to do a pull request is adding memes to the *handpicked memes* page.
..* Obviously, the images themselves for the memes are stored in 'memes/' each with its own category. You can add new images in there.
..* Then you can add them in memes.html
..* If you want to add a new category you can do that. For the title you will have to generate a spicy text image at <https://www.cooltext.com> with the title, make sure it's about the same size as the others and put it in `memes/`, like the other title images.

Any other pull requests are warmly welcomed.
