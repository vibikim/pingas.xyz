			<h2>Linux</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Install wireguard through your package manager. https://www.wireguard.com/install/ . After that, restart your computer so the kernel module loads properly.</li>
				<li>From now on everything should be run as root so so it is a good idea to do <b>$ sudo su</b> then <b># cd /etc/wireguard</b></li>
				<li>Generate a private and public key:
					<pre>
# umask 077
# wg genkey > dumpster
# wg pubkey < dumpster > dumpster.pub
					</pre>Read both your keys with <b>$ cat</b> or anything else, you will need them.</li>
				<li>Contact and give vibbe or ninkeo your public key and ask for what local ip to use.</li>
				<li>Create a file called <b>dumpster.conf</b> here, in /etc/wireguard, with the following contents:
					<pre>
[Interface]

Address = 192.168.55.<i>[1]</i>/32
Privatekey = **your private key**

[Peer]
PublicKey = a9T+Tp02KzhDxsgcn3gFGh1d6JfnE1WTRyMf4kgq6Ec=
AllowedIPs = 192.168.55.0/24
Endpoint = <i>[2]</i>
					</pre></li>
					<li>With the config saved you can turn up the network at any time with sudo <b>$ wg-quick up dumpster</b> (running it as root is important)
						and turn it down when you're done with <b>$ sudo wg-quick down dumpster</b>.</li>
			</ol>
				
		</div>
		<p style="color:black;"><i>[1]</i> Represents the network number that has been assigned to you by an admin.</p>
		<br><p style="color:black;"><i>[2]</i> The hostname that you will be able to find in the pinned messages of the Discord server (#gaming-general).</p>
